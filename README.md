# Pathman - Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

I created my first pathfinding algorithm from scrath without prior knowledge of known algorithms.
This gave me valuable insight into the kinds of problems that pathfinding has to solve.
Some examples are: time complexity, stack vs queue data structures, handling neighbor discovery, & outputing everything to the DOM in a digestable way.

Now in my second version, I've re-created 4 popular algorithms and show them in better detail at a speed that allows for deeper understanding of what's going on.

The four algorithms included are:
- A*
- Dijkstra
- Greedy Best first
- Depth first
